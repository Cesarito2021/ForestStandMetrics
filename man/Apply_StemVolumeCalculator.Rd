\usage{
Apply_StemVolumeCalculator(
  data,
  ForManInt_option,
  ForManInt,
  plot_option,
  plot_col,
  plot_area,
  dbh_col,
  th_col,
  specie_col
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the forest inventory data. The data should include columns for
diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, tree species, and optional columns for forest
management interventions and plot information.}

\item{ForManInt_option}{A string specifying whether forest management intervention data is provided
("Yes" or "No"). If "Yes", the function will use the intervention data in calculations.}

\item{ForManInt}{A string representing the name of the column containing forest management intervention
data (e.g., "Thinning", "Clearcut"). This column is used when \code{ForManInt_option} is "Yes".}

\item{plot_option}{A string specifying whether plot data is provided ("Yes" or "No"). If "Yes", the
function will include plot-level summaries in the output.}

\item{plot_col}{A string specifying the name of the column representing the plot identifier. Used
when \code{plot_option} is "Yes".}

\item{plot_area}{A numeric value representing the total area of the plot in hectares. This is used
for calculating plot-level data, such as volume and basal area per hectare.}

\item{dbh_col}{A string specifying the name of the column representing diameter at breast height (DBH)
in centimeters.}

\item{th_col}{A string specifying the name of the column representing tree height in meters.}

\item{specie_col}{A string specifying the name of the column representing tree species.}
}
\value{
A list of two data frames:
\itemize{
\item \code{output_plot}: A data frame with plot-level data, including total stem volume, basal area,
dominant tree species, and other metrics calculated per hectare.
\item \code{output_ForManInt}: A data frame summarizing forest management interventions (e.g., thinning)
and their impact on forest structure, including volume changes, basal area modifications, and species composition.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates stem volume, basal area, and identifies dominant tree species
based on forest inventory data. It also provides summaries at the forest management intervention
level and plot level, including volume per hectare, basal area, and other relevant metrics.
The function is particularly useful for forest management applications, allowing for efficient
analysis of inventory data and intervention strategies.
}
\details{
This function is designed to support forest management practices by providing both plot-level
and intervention-level summaries. It is useful for assessing the effectiveness of forest interventions
and understanding the structural changes in forest stands. The calculations include stem volume, basal area,
and dominant species identification, enabling comprehensive forest assessments.
