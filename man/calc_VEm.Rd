\title{Calculate the Vertical Evenness Index (VEm) for Forest Plots}
\usage{
calc_VEm(data, height_col, basal_area_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing tree data with height and basal area information.
The data should include at least one column for tree heights and one for basal area values.}

\item{height_col}{A character string specifying the column name containing tree heights (m).}

\item{basal_area_col}{A character string specifying the column name containing basal area values (mÂ²).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the Vertical Evenness Index (VEm). Higher values indicate
a more evenly distributed vertical biomass structure, while lower values indicate a more concentrated
biomass distribution at certain vertical strata.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Vertical Evenness Index (VEm), which is a measure of the vertical
distribution of biomass in a forest plot. The index considers both tree height and basal area
to evaluate how evenly the biomass is distributed across different vertical strata.
}
\details{
The Vertical Evenness Index (VEm) is calculated by assessing how evenly the biomass
(as determined by basal area) is distributed across different height strata within the forest.
A higher VEm value suggests a more evenly distributed biomass profile, which is often a desirable
trait in forest ecosystems for resilience and biodiversity. The formula for the calculation depends on
the specific method for dividing the plot into height classes and the biomass distribution in those classes.

# Example usage
data <- data.frame(height = c(10, 15, 20, 25), basal_area = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0))
calc_VEm(data, height_col = "height", basal_area_col = "basal_area")
