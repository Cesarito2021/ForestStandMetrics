Apply_ForStrSpecDiv(
  data,

  ForManInt,
  plot_option,
  plot_col,
  dbh_col,
  th_col,
  specie_col,
  plot_area
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing tree attributes for each plot. Must include relevant
columns such as tree diameter (dbh), tree height (th), species, and forest management intervention information.}

\item{ForManInt_option}{A string ("Yes" or "No") indicating whether forest management intervention
is considered in the dataset. If "Yes", the column specified in \code{ForManInt} is used to group results.}

\item{ForManInt}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the
forest management intervention (e.g., thinning, clearcut, etc.). Used only if \code{ForManInt_option} is "Yes".}

\item{plot_option}{A string ("Yes" or "No") indicating if the dataset contains multiple plots.
Defaults to "No" if not provided. If "Yes", data will be grouped by plot and summarized accordingly.}

\item{plot_col}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the plot identifier.
Used only if \code{plot_option} is "Yes".}

\item{dbh_col}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the diameter at breast height (dbh) of the trees.}

\item{th_col}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the height of the trees.}

\item{specie_col}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the species of the trees.}

\item{plot_area}{A numeric value representing the area of each plot in square meters, used for calculating per-hectare metrics.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames:
\item{output_plot_df}{A data frame summarizing the calculated forest structure and species diversity metrics at the plot level,
including basal area, species diversity, and other related attributes.}
\item{output_ForManInt}{A data frame summarizing the calculated metrics by forest management intervention,
including the average values across plots for each intervention type.}
}
\description{
This function calculates forest structure and species diversity metrics for forest plots,
including basal area (BA) and other related attributes, based on tree diameter at breast height (dbh),
tree height (th), and species data. The calculation is performed for each plot, and the results can be grouped
by forest management intervention. It returns summaries at both the plot level and the forest management intervention level,
allowing for comprehensive analysis of forest structure and species diversity across plots and interventions.
}
\details{
This function calculates various forest structure and species diversity metrics for each plot.
The main metric calculated is basal area (BA), which is derived from the diameter at breast height (dbh) of each tree.
Additionally, species diversity is measured, providing insights into the distribution of species across plots.
Results can be grouped by forest management interventions (if specified), and per-hectare metrics are calculated based on
the area of the plot provided in \code{plot_area}. The function provides summaries at both the plot level and the forest management intervention level.
