\usage{
Apply_All_Deadwood(
  data,
  ForManInt_option,
  ForManInt,
  plot_option,
  plot_col,
  H_Len_col,
  D_max_col,
  D_min_col,
  plot_area
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing tree attributes for each plot. Must include relevant
columns such as tree height, maximum and minimum diameter, and forest management intervention information.}

\item{ForManInt_option}{A string ("Yes" or "No") indicating whether forest management intervention
is considered in the dataset. If "Yes", the column specified in \code{ForManInt} is used to group results.}

\item{ForManInt}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the
forest management intervention (e.g., thinning, clearcut, etc.). Used only if \code{ForManInt_option} is "Yes".}

\item{plot_option}{A string ("Yes" or "No") indicating if the dataset contains multiple plots.
Defaults to "No" if not provided. If "Yes", data will be grouped by plot and summarized accordingly.}

\item{plot_col}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the plot identifier.
Used only if \code{plot_option} is "Yes".}

\item{H_Len_col}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the total length of the tree (used in volume calculation).}

\item{D_max_col}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the maximum diameter of the tree.}

\item{D_min_col}{A string representing the name of the column in the dataset that specifies the minimum diameter of the tree.}

\item{plot_area}{A numeric value representing the area of each plot in square meters, used to calculate the volume per hectare.}
}
\value{
A list containing two data frames:
\item{output_plot}{A data frame summarizing the calculated volumes at the plot level, including the volume per hectare.}
\item{output_ForManInt}{A data frame summarizing the calculated volumes by forest management intervention, including the average volume per hectare across plots.}
}
\description{
This function calculates the volume of deadwood for forest plots based on tree attributes
such as tree height, maximum and minimum diameters. The calculation is performed for each plot,
and the function can group the results by forest management interventions. It returns summaries
at both the plot level and the forest management intervention level, including volume per hectare.
}
\details{
This function calculates the volume of deadwood for forest plots using tree attributes such as
maximum and minimum diameters, total height (if required), and forest management intervention (if available).
The volume is computed for each tree, and results can be summarized by plot and/or forest management intervention.
The function also provides per-hectare volume estimates, depending on the plot size specified.
